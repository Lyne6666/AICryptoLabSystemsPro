# AICryptoLabSystemsPro

## Description

A library for cryptographic multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, optimized for performance using SIMD instructions and offering a Rust-based DSL for defining custom secure computations.

## Features

- Integrate TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for automated machine learning pipeline orchestration.
- Implement differential privacy techniques using Google's Private SQL for sensitive data analysis.
- Utilize Kubernetes for container orchestration and scalable deployment of AI models.
- Provide a RESTful API with JWT authentication for secure access to AI model predictions.
- Implement federated learning using PySyft to train models on decentralized datasets.
- Incorporate anomaly detection algorithms based on autoencoders for identifying unusual patterns in cryptocurrency trading data.
- Enable real-time data streaming from cryptocurrency exchanges using Apache Kafka for low-latency model inference.
- Develop a custom CUDA kernel for optimized matrix multiplication during neural network training on NVIDIA GPUs.
## Installation
