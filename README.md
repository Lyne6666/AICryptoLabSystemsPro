# AICryptoLabSystemsPro

## Description

Initial project setup

## Features

- Integrate a federated learning framework using differential privacy to train models across decentralized datasets.
- Implement a RESTful API endpoint for submitting cryptocurrency trading strategies encoded in Python.
- Utilize a directed acyclic graph (DAG) database to manage and track complex dependencies between AI model versions and training data.
- Employ a hardware security module (HSM) to securely store and manage cryptographic keys used for signing transactions.
- Leverage Kubernetes for container orchestration, enabling automated scaling and deployment of AI model inference services.
- Incorporate a time series database, such as InfluxDB, to efficiently store and analyze high-frequency market data.
- Develop a custom reinforcement learning environment using the OpenAI Gym toolkit, specifically tailored for cryptocurrency trading simulations.
- Implement a robust anomaly detection system using isolation forests to identify and flag suspicious trading patterns.
